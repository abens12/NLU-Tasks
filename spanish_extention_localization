# 2.2 Sample Utterances (Spanish):

Puedes poner jazz
[Puedes poner]<unk> [jazz]<genre>

Reproduce Ummagumma de Pink Floyd
[Reproduce]<unk> [Ummagumma]<album> [de]<unk> [Pink Floyd]<artist>

Pon Lady Gaga
[Pon]<unk> [Lady Gaga]<artist>

#as in the French language case, the utterance "Reproduce Ummagumma de Pink Floyd" includes a possessive article "de", therefore IT IS RECOMMENDED TO ADD SPECIFIC TAGS FOR PART OF SPEECH TAGS IN ORDER TO PARSE THE HOLE SENTENCE.


# 2.3 Possible Issues and Suggestions:

Ambiguity: 

As the grammar expands, ambiguity might arise. To overcome this, context or additional information might be required.

Grammar Complexity: 

As the grammar becomes more complex, maintaining and updating it might become challenging. Regular reviews and documentation can help mitigate this issue.

# 2.3 Features Complicating Localization:

Grammatical Structure: 

Languages may have different grammatical structures, which could complicate the direct translation of the grammar. A careful analysis of sentence structures and adjustments in the grammar may be needed.


# 2.4 Solutions or Workarounds:

Collaboration with Native Speakers: 

Engage native speakers or near native speakers for localization, ensuring accurate representation of language nuances and usage.

Iterative Development: 

Develop the grammar iteratively, testing and refining it with native speakers to address any issues that arise.

Documentation:

Document the grammar rules and exceptions thoroughly to facilitate maintenance and updates.

Contextual Information: 

Use context and additional information to disambiguate certain requests, especially in cases where the grammar might lead to multiple interpretations.
